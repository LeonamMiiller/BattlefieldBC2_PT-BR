Known as a "Battle Rifle" because its 7.62mm round and heavy frame, this weapon is capable of fully automatic fire at a rate of 600 rpm. The 20 round magazine is offset by the incredible stopping power of the 7.62mm round.
The father of the M14 assault rifle, the inaugural standard issue semi-automatic rifle utilized by the US army in WWII.  This weapon is full value due to its awesome power and accuracy from long range. 
9mm semi-automatic pistol which has served as the primary pistol of the US military. Equipped with a 15 round staggered magazine with reversible release. An optimal level of mobility accounts for considerable lack of power.

Developed in Russia in the 1940s, the AK47 has become the world's most popular and widely used assault rifle thanks to its reliability and stopping power.
Filled with various calibers of ammunition, this bullet box is deployed functioning as an ammo point enabling soldiers to re-load and re-stock their ammo supply.

SPAWNING IN:
DTN-4 (Plastic Explosives). A C-4 charge safely and easily transported, but once armed is susceptible to detonation if handled inproperly. It can be attached to most surfaces for easy rigging and setup. An added feature is its ability to be remotely triggered by an operator (command-detonation).  ½
Automated External Defibrillator (AED) - capable of resuscitating victims in a state of cardiac arrest. Administration must be done within seconds of arrest.  It is inadvisable to use it on healthy individuals or as a form of "entertainment".
This fully automatic Belgian assault rifle features a bullpup layout and offers a selection of modifications ranging from scopes to grenade launcher attachments enabling it to be tailored for any given mission or tactical situation.

OBJECTIVE:
LEAVING SQUAD‚
US Army utility vehicle. Provides infantry with rapid transportation and 360 degree, .30 calibre firepower
A favorite sidearm among special forces this 7 round semi-automatic pistol boasts a .45 caliber stopping power enabling the operator to dispose of an opponent with lethal close range fire.½
A 6 round revolver revered for its close range edge and notable Magnum firepower. Its top break design is a throw back to old 6-shooters of the "Wild West".
Adopted as sidearm for all branches of the Russian military and law enforcement, this 17 round semi-automatic pistol boasts high mobility and operates with a short recoil. 
Ideal for close quarters where the "continuum of force" has been isolated to hand to hand combat. For optimum performance, the leading edge "pointy end" should be applied to the enemy and thrust into vital areas. This should be repeated as necessary.
Man, I definitely saw something. I think they're just watching us
Why are they just watching us?

Russian made submachine gun designed with simplicity and mass production in mind. Almost 6 million PPSh machine pistols have been manufactured and users commend its low recoil and close range firepower.
The Type 88 is a new Chinese semi automatic rifle used as a marksman weapon rather than a sniper rifle. Able to employ various optics, the weapon has backup iron sights and a 10 round magazine.
Ah this is some fancy tech right here, next generation Russian UAV, Dozor-3 I think.
Pump action shotgun. 4 rounds. Very high power. Very short range. High mobility.
New generation 5.8mm Chinese light machine gun. Heavier than many of its competitors, the Type 88 (also known as QJY 88) is a gas operated, air cooled, fully automatic LMG with a cyclic rate of 650 round per minute.
Chinese made 35mm automatic grenade launcher.  It has a "light" configuration that allows it to be man-portable.  It is toted as being able to provide anti-air and light anti-armor support.  ½

A U.S. communication center with a commanding view of the local area has been selected as a next target by the Russian Forces. Russian Command  will first have to cross a rich agricultural valley and secure the nearby town before preparations for a final assault can begin.  The open fields and local farms will see intense vehicle combat as both sides have moved armored assets into the theater.

The American capture of Valparaiso is the next phase in their strategic plan to repel Russian Forces from Chile. Any U.S. invasion will inevitably consist of a land assault through the outlying jungle areas and an amphibious landing of infantry and armored forces along the coast. The U.S objective is the Power Station on the outskirts of the city. If the installation can be captured and services cut off, the liberation of the city will inevitably follow suit.

A Russian Naval Group is preparing a massive amphibious assault. Defending the shore are 3 U.S fortifications and a string of artillery defenses. Should the Russians establish a beachhead and overrun U.S. positions, they will be free to advance further inland. With weather deteriorating and sandstorms approaching, U.S. Command has consolidated all available forces to meet the Russian threat. As a result of the open ground, a large-scale armor battle supported by attack helicopters seems likely.

Following the results of the armor assault at Atacama, U.S Command insists on a similar action to capture the port of Arica. The assault group will launch a "break through" action directly at the Russian base. If the fight dictates, the Battle Group will cut directly through the town located on the axis of advance. Collateral damage is of no consequence. The Russian base must be destroyed in order to cross the desert and reach the port. Heavy casualties are expected on both sides.

The local town has not been attacked, but Russian units have probed defenses in the surrounding woods. The sector has strategic value to U.S Forces as it allows control of inland routes.

Winter has hit hard.  The river has frozen allowing heavy equipment and personnel to operate throughout the sector. However, the extreme weather and surrounding woods make it unlikely that any assault will consist of heavy armor. Satellite reconnaissance indicates Russian Special Forces and airborne units have been pulled away from South America and are gathering on mass.  A nighttime assault is eminent. Nelson Bay harbors an underground U.S submarine base that will be defended at all cost.

INFO: TEAMPLAY
Christ that was close, everyone ok?

Gravity causes bullets to drop as they travel.  Aim above your target to get a headshot at long range.
The Quad Bike makes a great flanking vehicle, use it to surround your enemy.
Tanks have more armor in front and are weak in the rear.  Shoot enemy tanks from behind or the sides to win tank battles quickly.
In Tanks and AA vehicles the Firepower Package adds a Light Machinegun for the Driver.
Helicopter Gunners and Light Tanks gain a TOW Guided Antiarmor Missile with the Firepower Package.
The Improved Warheads Package increases the damage effectiveness of all vehicle weapons.
The UAV can call in a Hellfire strike with the fire button.  Keep your crosshair on the target until the missile hits.
Reviving your teamates will refund your team reinforcement Tickets.
Killing enemies near a Squad Objective will yield score bonuses.
As a MEDIC, be sure to use your DEFIBRILLATOR to quickly revive fallen comrades. 
If you are playing ASSAULT kit, drop a few AMMUNITION BOXES to make sure no-one runs out of ammo.
When using the ENGINEER kit, stay close to friendly vehicles as they rely on you and your REPAIR TOOL.
If youre a MEDIC and the bullets start flying around you and your friends, be prepared for casualties by placing a MEDIC KIT nearby.
Reviving a fallen soldier using the MEDICs DEFIBRILLATOR will give your team the lost resource ticket back.
To keep a strong frontline, make sure you respawn on your Squad Members when possible.
 If the rest of your squad has fallen, stay alive!  Your squadmates can use you as a mobile spawn point!
TRACER DARTS placed on enemy vehicles can be tracked by portable ANTI-TANK weapons as well as ATTACK HELICOPTERS.
Players using the combat support gadgets such as DEFIBRILLATORS, REPAIR TOOLS and AMMUNITION BOXES will be generously rewarded and find themselves progressing faster through the ranks.

The valley and surrounding mountains possess a strategic value in the battle for South America.  Construction of the nearby Dam was halted when hostilities broke out, but its presence is still a significant factor.  Airborne operations are limited but infantry assault supported by light armor vehicles is likely by both armies. U.S Forces are massing all available units to stage a defense and have wired the dam to prevent it from falling into Russian hands.

"Possessing a high level of performance and durability, the Austrian made fully automatic AUG bullpup assault rifle is boosted by stellar mobility making it ideal for combat in close quarters and built up areas. 
With outstanding accuracy this rifle provides exceptional performance in difficult situations.  Its long range and pinpoint accuracy makes it the rifle of choice with German police agencies and counter terrorist units.   
This modified version of the M14, a 20 round semi-automatic battle rifle represents a weapon tailored for carrying out designated marksman roles, augmented with a telescoping stock that aids in long range combat.½
The American made M16A2 three round burst assault rifle carries a 30 round magazine and was designed to optimize ammunition conservation, shot accuracy and fire power. 
Originally designed to use the .30-06 Magnum cartridge it was eventually re-chambered to use the 7.62 round.  This did not reduce the range or the stopping power as the M24 still is popular with sniper teams worldwide.
Portable flamethrower capable of producing a jet of burning fuel
Portable flamethrower capable of producing a jet of burning fuel. Ideal for clearing out bunkers and other tight spaces.
The Patton was the US main battle tank during the cold war period and the M48 was the principal MBT of the Vietnam war.
Utilizing design elements from the WW II MG42, the M60 was introduced in 1957 and has been the workhorse of every branch of the U.S. Military.  It has gone through several modifications but is slowly being phased out by the M240.
A modern version of the WWII MG42, the MG3 serves over 20 countries because of its simple design and excellent performance. With 1,000 rounds per minute, the MG3 is an incredible force multiplier. Its a testament to the original design that after 70 years it still proves strong.
A an integral tool for scouting and collecting real time intelligence, this portable high tech device is designed for sensing even the slightest twitch of movement alerting an owner when an enemy has breached the premises on foot, or by vehicle.
Patrol Boat Light is a high speed and maneuverable watercraft designed for insertion/extraction, fire support, and reconnaissance of low-to-medium threat level environments.  Armed with 2 x 20mm automatic Grenade Launchers, it operates with a crew of 4.½
Russian general purpose machine gun adopted worldwide for its rugged operation and reliability. With a high rate of fire and 7.62x54mm caliber it provides excellent long range capability.½
Personal Water Craft (PWC) is a high speed, all weather boat designed to insert 2 personnel into enemy occupied territory.½
The T-54 is the most produced MBT in history, having been involved in numerous conflicts since WWII. Its 100mm cannon was a major threat to anything caught in its way.
Sacrificing stopping power and accuracy the bullpup design is based on the Dragunov SVD. The SVU was originally designed for Russian airborne but was adopted by police forces for urban operations.
Remotely operated Unmanned Ariel Vehicle tasked with Forward Air Control and Over-watch it can call in both air strikes and real-time battlefield intelligence.  It can be equipped with a .50 caliber HMG or smoke dispensers.½
This German built, 25 round, fully automatic sub machine gun is noted for its versatility, optimal mobility and silencer, making it a suitable choice for ground forces engaged in close quarters combat. 
This legendary Israeli submachine gun was designed for personal defense, proving to be very effective in securing confined areas. Its a reliable choice among countless ground forces.
The VSS is compact, silenced and chambered for the subsonic 9x39 mm round.  The round differs from standard 9 mm in that it delivers more energy and penetrating capability up to a range of 400 meters.
An experimental US military project, the XM8 P fully automatic rifle was created with a unique versatility, allowing the operator to perform quick repairs and barrel changes in a hot spot.

These guys are talking about something. A force multiplier. ½Oh, the compound's a force multiplier!
It means the scalar weapon is gonna be on steroids. We'll be vaporized!



Any weapons we find from now on, we store them in here.½We can equip whatever we have found from crates like this. Got it?

Hey, you missed a spot, Wyatt.
There it is. Now we wait.
Sarge, you think this Aurora thing's really there?
That's what they say.
"That's what they say, that's what they say". What d'you think, Mckee?
I dunno, Faraday, but I guess you're gonna tell me?
See, the way I figure it, we got atomic bombs, Krauts got V-2s,½the Japs have gotta have something too.
We're here for the scientist. That is it.
Hey, Able Squad's ready, Sarge.
Okay, start the engine.
Take us in.
Stop!
There... Up there, patrol.
Stay on Able.
Kill the engine.
No sound.
Go, Wyatt!
Where the fuck are they headed?
Shit!
Get down!
Shit!
Shit!
Get the hell out!
Get out of the open!
What are you doing? Move!
Come on!










We're clear.
Anyone hit?
Able Squad didn't make it, Sarge.
Oh, shit! Alright, it's up to us then.
How come it ain't started yet, Sarge? They said 0600.
Right on time.
Hope it worked.
Mckee, if they can take what we're throwin' at 'em now, they can keep the defector!
Let's get moving!
We're going high road. Wyatt, take the trenches.
Are we gonna take care of those guns, Sarge?
No we aren't, Faraday, that isn't the mission. Good luck, Wyatt.
Go on, boys.
Okay, this way. Move!
Down there, across the field... Go.
Mines... Watch your step.
Stop!
Get down! Down!
Jap armor. Don't move.
Where the hell is he? He ought to be here by now.
Stop, don't move!
Give him the challenge.
Who is my favorite baseball player?
Cap Anson.
Great. Let's get him outta here.
Hang on a second. What the hell was that sound?
What's he saying?
I don't- I don't know, Sarge.
If you sold us out...
The Black Weapon... It's starting... We are dead men!
Okay, we're going, pal.
It's no use.
Maybe you didn't understand me, we are getting outta here!
Sarge, they just cut off our primary.
All right, we'll go through the sub pen.
It's a God damn deathtrap!
Yeah, I know.
Sarge, I guess that's our ride.
Alright fellas, get ready...
Go.
C'mon, c'mon, move it!
Get that God damn hatch open!
We made it... We made it. You see? I told you we'd make it, Wyatt!

COMPARE
So that's it.
Yes. The Americans have lost this sector. Others will follow. It would be prudent for you to consider our proposal.
Forget it. You can go to hell. 
Very soon I may. Very soon. But as the victor.
We'll see.
Remember my friend. There are always men willing to endure suffering for a cause. ½But there are more willing to inflict it. 
...Which man are you?
Prick.

Oh, shit! That's our agent!
Archangel, this is Bravo Two, I got eyes on vehicle and possible HVT subject.
Copy that, Two.
No, no, oh shit!
You fuckin'...
Archangel, requesting kill on subject ASAP.
Sarge?
Archangel, he's mobile...
Bravo Two Actual, hold your fire. Hold your fire.
I had him! We let that piece of shit go?
You ain't got shit on no-one unless I say you do! Simmer the fuck down, your time'll come.
Archangel, subject is gone, vehicle is still present.
Bravo Two Actual, the town has been declared hostile. Secure the vehicle.
That's a solid copy, Archangel. Out.
You heard the man...

Hurry up! Get in!
Damn... Y'all still with me? Hags?
Yeah...
Sweetwater?
Whoa... Now this is interesting.

It's a fake, what you found.
Fake, sir?
A dummy. We think it's a dry run.
For what exactly, sir?
They're building a weapon.
What we know about it so far scares the shit out of us, what we don't know scares us a lot more.
So we need more intel. We need it last week, that's where you...
Mmmm... Yeah... Okay.
Listen, I need this done ricky tick.
I got nine other units in shit so deep they've forgotten what the sun looks like.
So, you work for us now.
We want you to do what you do best. Be unorthodox. Be lethal.
You do that, you can go home. All of you can go home.
Sir, what do you mean home? Home home, sir?
Yep. Can you do that for me?
We can do that, sir.
Now, this object you found. We got an asset in Bolivia, this is his specialty.
Name's Aguire. Give him this.
Oh... Welcome to Special Activities Division.
What just happened?
I think my retirement just got postponed, that's what just happened. Again.
Special Activities Division?
Hell fucking yes!
Bolivia?
Next thing we knew we were over South America,
courtesy of an agency we couldn't offically name,
working for a guy who sent units like ours to early graves every day.
Technically, our luck was improving.
So this Aguire's gotta be some highly placed CIA spook to be out here solo.
Uh huh.
I dont like it.
I dont like any of it.
Hey, err, Flynn, right? What's our ETA?
Flynn?
Mr. Pilot, sir?
Come on, dude!
Uh, shoot, man, I just...
Hang on, man. I just... I lost my smokes, I... Hang on a minute.
Fucking Tuesdays, man, I never get my shit together on a Tuesday.
When are we gonna get there?
Couple o' minutes.
Whoa, how 'bout that?
Oh! RPG! RPG!
Yeah, I saw it.
Whoa, what the fuck?
Now you see these cheap Russian RPGs, they're easy, man.
If that was like a Javelin I'd a had to do something really tricky.
Can you just get us to the fucking LZ, before I have to do something real tricky, too?
Right, right, you got it, boss.
Command, this is Ghost Rider reconfirming insert, six four four niner.
Two bodies. That's it.
We're wastin' our time!
Wait, wait, wait...
Jesus Christ, the guy is fucking dead.
We're gonna get pinned down waiting for CSI New Jersey here to tell us what we already know.
Aguire is still alive, they would've taken these bodies otherwise.
Hmm...
Yeah, it's a clue. Aguire must have left it.
Matches right there, fits right to the grid. We gotta go upriver.
Alright, call Flynn.
Flynn's gone, Hags.
This just gets better and better, don't it?
Uh...
We got company.
I guess that's our guy.
Is that a Russian?
Where are they taking him?
Yeah, I don't know, but I got an idea of how we gonna find out.
Marlowe, we're gonna try to get close.
You snipe, take out the guards.
Use the thunder to hide your shots.
Is it wrong of me to say I wish I'd thought of that?
Yes!
We're Oscar Mike, stay frosty!
Hold up, hold up...
Tripwire.
Shit! How did you see that?
My spidey-senses were tingling.
Thanks. Thanks, Hags.
Look, I wasn't raised in the suburbs, ya frickin' mallrat.
Turn those TOW's, now!
Aahh... Shit...
Hags, take my hand! Maybe it's time to cut back on the milkshakes, hero...
Hey... Thanks, bro.

Hmm. They're dug in here like an Alabama tick...
That guard tower over there.
And then that one.
Alright, we're gonna lay down a base of fire.
Best bet is to go straight, jump down into that riverbed over there, and we pin 'em down.
Then you hit 'em from the side.
There he is.
Yeah... They're taking him up there, I guess. Looks well defended, too.
This gon' get real ugly...

Over there!
I guess we're gonna have to do this the hard way.
TAAAAANK!
Major Aguire?
Gun!
Damn!
No problem, we're square.
Sir, Braidwood sent us.
We have something to show you.
Alright then, show it to me.
God damn, they really did it.
Braidwood said it was a fake.
Of course it's a fake, I told 'em it'd be a fake. Christ!
They wouldn't just move the actual weapon there, we knew that already.
We did?
Hags!
Alright, so, a couple months back we set up a relay off an old French weather satellite, hook into this Georgian milnet.
Found out plenty, the dummy weapon was just part of it. Then these guys showed up.
They got all your intel?
Yeah.
No backups?
Where?
The satellite controls were in the Andes.
Aguire said we could bring it down...
In theory.
Okay boys, you just lay down some fire on those targets over there.
Alright. Marlowe, Haggard, get on those miniguns and start firing.
Ain't you gonna help us, Flynn?
What, me? No way, man. I'm a pacifist.
What? Pacifist! How can you be a God damned pacifist?
Yeah, it's bad for my karma, man. I don't mess with karma, I just fly.
Hags, let it go!
Fuck that! That don't fly with me, space-muffin.
I'm gonna hawk you to the God damn magic kingdom!
Love you, man.
Ya silly, God damned, muffin-headed, fucking liberal!
Done. We should be able to see it any minute now.
Luckily, this thing's mostly broken as is, and real easy to hack.
Yeah, God bless the French.
Okay...
Now we need to get the data server from inside that thing.
Okay, there it is. It'll land about a klick away, I guess.
You sure about that?
Haggard, I just brought this bitch down on a dime, from orbit, so a little respect!
Very little.
Sarge, look, we need a ride...
I hear you. There's one, right over there.
Sweet Jesus!
That is the greatest thing I have ever seen in my entire life!
Ahhh, let's just go get the damn satellite!
XM22
AUTO GL
HMG
Go get the black box.
Data server. Look, I'm not the Human Torch, I can't touch that thing, it's two thousand degrees.
It's radiation hardened, so--
Weather's turning. You two secure the black box.
We're gonna go and try and salvage a vehicle.
We better raise Sarge.
Alright, well I'll be right back. Don't shoot me!
Sweetwater?
Sweets?
Damn it!
LW PACK
Welcome back, prodigal guy!
Hang on!
This- this is a scalar weapon!
Beautiful, isn't it?
But you can't be serious?
You never heard of Operation Aurora?
Yeah I have, but look, even if you could produce a scalar field--
First there'd be a localized Carrington event in the troposphere--
Stop, stop, stop. In English.
A scalar weapon creates very powerful electromagnetic pulses.
So?
So, they trigger it in the right spot, down goes the US power grid.
Then as our fine country slips into total fucking anarchy, the Russians decide to come knocking.
The end!
So we better find this guy...
Arkady Kirilenko.
Shit!
Ain't that the fella you didn't shoot?
He's connected to this project?
Kirilenko is the project! But we move this second or he's gone...
I should clear this with Braidwood.
No! No, no, no! He'll just send some special ops douchebags,
with pussy-ass heartbeat monitors on their guns, instead of us!
Sarge?
Man, I'm 44 years old. I got you three bastard kids to look after, a career going nowhere.
This was supposed to be my last God damn mission! I can't do this again, I just can't.
What about saving the U.S?
And then what?
That's all.
Okay, so you're in.
Kirilenko still breathing's my fault.
Sweets?
Let me think about it, yes!
Haggard?
Hell... I'm not ready to make nice, and I'm not ready to back down.
I'm in.
Alright, here it is...
You're gonna piggyback on a U.S armored op in the area to get to Kirilenko.
It's the only way.
So we went south, toward Chile.
I guess Aguire had some friends in high places, cause there were U.S tanks waiting for us.
We hadn't had support in a long time, so it felt a little like Christmas.
Except our present was a crazy Russian colonel.
Truth is, I'd had worse holidays.
Bravo Two, this is Riverguard, come in, over.
Go ahead, Riverguard.
Kirilenko's last known position puts him in a settlement, possibly a compound, near the Talinay wind farms.
Do whatever you can to take him alive, but you know the drill, do what you have to do.
Understood, Riverguard. Bravo Two, out.
Kodiak Three, we're changing route. Welcome to the red zone.
Hoorah Bravo Two. You guys with Delta?
They wish. What's the plan Sarge?
The plan? Our combined forces, we secure this Kirilenko guy's escape route.
There's no... You mean the drainage pipes?
Yeah, that's what I talking about. It's gonna be hard work.
Well nobody ever drowned in sweat, sir, we'll see you there.

Designed to maximize the carriers mobility during battle by employing more compact equipment options.  This setup dramatically spreads load and allows for a more efficient carry. 
Hmm... Okay, crazy idea number three.
Ah here we go.
You see those fuel trucks?  We commandeer one of them, strap some C4 on it, collapse the whole tunnel.
I'll be damned. That could work.
Yeah, saw it in Predator. Maybe True Lies.


You alright Marine?
Yeah, I'm glad you fellas came with tho, you saved our ass.
Uh, so look. Higher says they're gonna bomb the whole place back to the stone age in t-minus five.
Of course, someone told them we were here.
Alright, thanks Marine. I'll take that on advisement.
Sir, yes, sir.
Alright, let's ride.
Sarge, with respect, what the fuck? I mean, if there's anything left of us, they'll be putting it in ziplock bags.
I ain't deaf Sweets, and I don't care! This Russian shitbird's goin' down today.
I dunno who this is, but that ain't him.
Move, Hags, let me see.
You're right, it ain't him.
This guy had some real interesting shit on him.
Satphone, bunch of calling cards, fifty grand in U.S currency.
But that ain't the good part...
Says he knows where Kirilenko is, and says he'll tell us if we let him go.
Alright, give us a few seconds, huh.
Hey, how long you reckon?
Ten seconds.
Huh, five!
Five... Four... Three... Two... One...
Bingo!
Damn it!
Rally up, fellas.
Okay, I've got Kirilenko's location. Marines, we're gonna need your humvees and your shooters.
Whatever you need, sir.
What'd you say to that prisoner, Sarge?
Nothin', I just told him why we were here.
And he just gave it up?
Yep, said he had family in Houston.
Texan...
Sometimes people are just people, man.
Mount up!
I see... You have the orders to take me alive.
Yeah.
Thank you!
Shoot him if he moves.
Always the same thing.
I beg your pardon?
You say "shoot him if he moves", but you will not.
You should admit the truth of this situation.
Now the situation is we got all the guns.
Sarge, it's a shipping manifest, The Sangre Del Toro.
So, who sent you?
Uh, we need to go now, as opposed to later!
Aguire sent you, didn't he?
He is a clever adversary, you know? A fine move to capture me here.
Sarge!
Adversary?
He's played well to get this far. So have you, I grant you that.
Where the hell did Rasputin go?
Ah, forget about him, just move!
Fuck!
Hey, you kiss your mom with that mouth?
I'm proud of you, Pres!
Hey, someone gimme a smoke, huh? I'm parched.
Sweet Jesus, you crazy, fucking hippie!
Ghost Rider here, never fear!
I told you, we don't know if he's dead.
Let's hope he is, otherwise...
Otherwise, how about you tell us about the ship?
The Sangre de Toro was a Panama registered freighter.½Went missing in '49 off the coast of Peru.
And you have no idea why he wanted it, or what was on it, or how it wound up in the desert?
No, I don't! But if he wants it, so do we.
Good luck.
Hey, I think I got a solution...
Roger that. Haggard...
This is your stop amigos. It's as far as I go...
LIGHTWEIGHT COMBAT EQUIPMENT
Maybe no-one's home.
Maybe.
Okay. What to do, what to do, what to do...
When this needle moves...
Turn...
Turn this dial!
It worked! I'll be damned...
Be all you can be, my ass.
Hey, if anything happens, you know...
Bury me at Cowboy Stadium. Arlington, Texas...
Lone Star State.
Okay, hmm... I know it's one of these buttons here...
And that...
Hmm, I knew I should've take that adult education course...
Maybe I'd even know Powerpoint too. 
Ah, there!
Alright, now get a move on, I got it from here.
Okay, it's done.
What the? Damn it! Uh, Preston, I gotta stay here and keep the signal from oscillating,½you're gonna need to relocate now to a new grid square while I adjust some... Some stuff.
And maybe I can do a little Aguire research while I'm here.
Aww, yeah, Sangre de Toro, there you are, you nimble little minx.
I- I'm adding coordinates for you now...
So there I was...
In a ship that was supposed to be lost,
looking for something that should have stayed buried.
I had my reasons...
We all did...
Going home.
Then I found it...
And everything changed.
Okay, what do you see?
Marlowe, you're awful quiet over there?
Well, this whole Operation Aurora thing?
I think I just found part of it.
What? What?
Yeah baby!
Sarge? Sarge, give me the comm.
Okay, Preston, go! No, wait, I- I'm patching in Aguire too. Okay...
Yeah...
 It looks like we knew the Japanese had scalar tech as early as '43?
This Operation Aurora was a suicide mission.
We sent these guys in to die, all of 'em!
Wyatt, Faraday...
Wyatt? They knew?
Yeah...
They even had projected unit casualties...
I guess they needed to know what the weapon would do.
Wait!
Okay, run this code... Sierra Foxtrot one oh seven niner.
That's a U.S military prefix, but nothin' even our clearance can reference.
How much?
Hard to say...
Just see the one.
Just take it and get out ASAP, this area's too hot.
We're pulling all our operatives out.
Solid copy.
Things were really heating up with Russians putting on the pressure.
We went north to meet Aguire so we could get the hell out.
We almost made it too...
It don't look very important does it?
Yeah, well that's how it is. Remember, Troy fell because of a woman...
Okay, alright.
Troy... The Illiad... Hell of a book!
Point is we got it. We gotta get this to Aguire pronto.
I dunno about this guy, you know?
You find anything on him back at the console?
He's a spook, nothing makes sense.
Incoming! It's a javelin!
Oh, fuck!
I'm gonna put it down.
Come on, bro! It's no time for heroics!
Go on, man. Get going. I got it...
Marlowe. Rifle, there.
Units moving in...
A minute, maybe less...
I guess it's just you and me.
Let's go to work!
Do you have the canister?
Yeah, we got it. But our pilot's been captured, we're not leaving without him.
Bravo Two, you're coming in broken and stupid.
We need the compound, we'll send an extract team for the pilot.
The compound?
How do you know it's a compound, you said you didn't know what was on that ship?
Bravo Two, just deliver it to my grid. We don't have time for this "no-one gets left behind, hip-hip-hooray" bullshit.
You have the coordinates. Do your fucking job!
So what're we gonna do now?
Damn it, somebody say something!
Shit, I don't know about you, but I think it's time to go and rescue us a commie, pinko, liberal pilot called "my friend".
Haggard, for once, I completely agree with you.
I thought you were a pacifist?
Sometimes even the Buddha had to kick a little ass.
Hey! Oh, thats good...
Right, you got it under control, lads.
Oh, here you go...
Wow!
That is- that is righteous, man!
They will give you cancer though...
I dunno how you're plannin' to get out of here?
There was a base on the way down here. Choppers, full of them... So...
Right, well, let's roll!
Here's your shit! Now tell us what's goin' on?
You tell me?
This was a con?
My friend is a very dedicated man.
You see, for years he was my rival in the quest for the weapon... No longer.
Why?
Because they lied to me...
Who? Who lied to you?
Who lied to me?
Yes!
What does it matter?
Because I did a little digging on you... Nothing interesting.
And then you went all loopy when you heard the name "Thomas Wyatt".
Now, he had a son, James, about your age. Stop me if this rings any bells...
Your father was a commando, Thomas Wyatt. An' I think, when you found out your government got him killed, you flipped!
The government, they lied, didn't they?
I had forgiven everything...
Until I heard they knew about the weapon... Until then!
That's why this country needs to be erased!
You're fucking nuts! You can't just destroy a nation for payback.
I can't, no...
But he can.
I concur!
This is Ghost Rider, I guess the negotiations didn't work out, huh?
Anyway, karma and me, we're good, so get a move on. The world needs saving.
And, Haggard... Thanks for the smokes, brother!
No!
Go! Get out of here! Go!
So... What now, Sarge?
We just put the final piece of the weapon in their God damn hands, I don't know.
We have a change of plans. The Russian Colonel is moving to the harbor, we cannot find the Americans... Be vigilant.
Marlowe, take him down.
I got this one, Sarge.
Whoa... Damn!
Ain't that plane we saw before?
Why are they gettin' on...?
Wait, wait, wait! Why is the plane glowing?
Oh, no. No! No! No! No! No!
Get down!
Sweets...
Am I dead?
No... I think they just test fired the weapon.
The scalar weapon must be on the plane...
I don't wanna do this...
Yeah, I dunno... I'm kinda inclined to agree with Haggard.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Preston, we're outta our league... I think we oughta go.
Go? Go where? Home?
There won't be a home! Won't be anything!
Sweetwater... That's it?
I guess you really weren't cut out for this special ops after all!
The shit hits the fan, and you want out!
Sarge? You just gonna lay down?
I see...
Fine, I'll go my fucking self!
No, Preston, you won't!
And, you two, you listen to Marlowe, and you listen good. Come on now...
Sweets, this is interesting stuff, man. Don't you wanna know how this ends?
Ya had me at "interesting".
Hags, come on now... If you leave, no more T-bone steaks, man...
Yeah. No more buying AR-15 ammo at the mall...
No more shootin' trespassers on your porch...
No more biscuits and gravy...
No more Super Bowl Sundays...
No more Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders...
Shit, That's tore it. Get outta my way! I gotta save me some cheerleaders!














So how you doing? You look good!
That's real funny, Marlowe. If we don't die out here, I'm fixin' on skinning you like a deer.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, the plane's moving...
Look at the size of that thing!
That's an AN-225... Mriya, means "Dream".
It's an enlarged version of the AN-124. Biggest ever built, can carry 253 tons of equipment.
What? I can know stuff!
Shouldn't the weapon have killed the plane too?
Yeah! Seems like ground zero is safe with scalar weapons, but outside it...
Well, anyway, I don't think we can knock that thing down....
So who wants to hijack a plane?


It was a long night...
Waiting...
Planning...
But, that thing about always darkest before the dawn?
Sometimes you just need to turn on a light...

It'd take an act of God to get through that. Or a lot of C-4.
Yeah, probably rip the plane apart to do it.
You remember the layout, of the cockpit?
Yeah, all up here! Don't you worry...
Okay, anyone here ever fly a plane?
Okay, well, uh... We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Let's go.
Where the hell is Kirilenko?
We're about 130 klicks outside of Texas, closing fast.
Sarge, we are outta time.
Gentlemen... All the compound you have given me will shield us from the blast.
Oh, and for that I am very grateful.
Enjoy...
It's not entirely true we couldn't get into the weapon room, is it?
Well, no, but...
Ah, fuck it already! Retirement would have been boring anyway.

You are too late... We are nearly at zero point!
I don't think so...
Do it!
What? What are you doing?
Get back, boys.
Hey... It's showtime!


This fucking thing's goin' down!
Come on!
Where's Kirilenko?
Go! Go! Go!
Aaaaaaaaaah...
It will not end today, believe me!



We're in Texas! Home, sweet home!
Okay, okay, okay, I guess I had to visit sooner or later.
Oh, man, what are we gonna do now?
Sarge? You ain't saying much?
I think you gotta ask Marlowe here... Thanks to him I'm officially retired.
Yeah, hell of a job, Marlowe!
Me? Aw, shucks, Sweets, what about you?
I dunno, it was cool but... You know, this special ops shit, not my style.
Well, now we need to party, and I know an establishment you're gonna love!
There's this girl called Chantal and she can--
Squad!
Attention!
Gentlemen.
Sir!
At ease. 
You have the heartfelt thanks of the United States government.
Now, I'm sorry as hell to say this, but I need you all to come with me.
But why, sir?
The Russians... They're invading.
Ah, sir, no they're not, sir. We just blew up that fucking ultimate weapon of theirs.
P.S. Invasion cancelled, sir.
Not here...
They're coming in through Alaska!
Alaska?
There are times it sucks to be right...
